                The Declaration of Independence of Albania is the declaration of the independence of the Albanian vilayet from the Ottoman Empire in the conditions of the First Balkan War. Albania was declared independent in Vlora on November 28, 1912 by Ismail Qemali. 40 delegates from all Albanian territories participated in the declaration of independence. Immediately after the declaration of independence, the Assembly of Vlora formed the first government of Independent Albania led by Ismail Qemali and the Eldership. The assembly of 40 delegates in the Kasabana of Vlora on November 28, 1912, proclaimed the independence of Albania. The minutes after which the signatures of the envoys who arranged for the announcement were listed were dictated by Ismail Qemali.

              The population of Albania has changed during last 30 years. This comes especially because
              of the changes in economic system, passing from centralized economy to an open market system,
              which has given its effect in births, deaths, migration, and definitely has an impact in the
              future of Albanian population.

            <p>
              Albania has been a secular state since 1912, and as such, is "neutral in questions of belief 
              and conscience". The former socialist government declared Albania the world's first 
              "atheist state", even though the Soviet Union had already done so. Believers faced 
              harsh punishments, and many clergymen were killed. Religious observance and practice 
              is generally lax today, and polls have shown that, compared to the populations of 
              other countries, few Albanians consider religion to be a dominant factor in their lives.
               When asked about religion, people generally refer to their family's historical religious
                legacy and not to their own choice of faith.

        <p>
          Albania is implementing important structural reforms that will support equitable growth, 
          raise productivity and competitiveness in the economy, create more jobs, 
          and improve governance and public service delivery. Enhanced regional connectivity 
          and access to regional and global markets, coupled with export and market diversification, 
          can also help promote faster growth.  

          After weathering the consequences of the 2019 earthquake, COVID-19 pandemic, and price crisis,
           the government’s focus is now on full recovery with special attention on tourism, agriculture, 
           and industrial sector.  It is encouraging to see that there is increased attention to climate change 
           and the environmentally-friendly interventions across economic sectors.
